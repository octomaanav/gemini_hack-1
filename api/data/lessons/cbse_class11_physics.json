The scientific method involves several interconnected steps: 1) Systematic observations, 2) Controlled experiments, 3) Qualitative and quantitative reasoning, 4) Mathematical modeling, and 5) Prediction and verification or falsification of theories. A theory can never be proven absolute; it can only be falsified by a single contradictory experiment.",

For example, Maxwell's equations unify electricity, magnetism, and optics. **Reductionism** is the effort to derive the properties of a bigger, more complex system from the properties and interactions of its constituent simpler parts. For example, thermodynamics (macroscopic) is understood through kinetic theory (microscopic).",

                            "introduction": "In the previous chapter, we discussed motion along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. However, in the real world, objects rarely move in perfect straight lines. A cricket ball hit into the air, a planet orbiting the sun, or a car turning a corner all undergo motion in a plane (two dimensions) or space (three dimensions). To analyze this, we need a mathematical framework that handles magnitude and direction simultaneously.",

                                    "explanation": "In one-dimensional motion, direction is indicated simply by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign. For example, velocity is either positive (forward) or negative (backward). In a plane, an object can move in infinite directions. A simple sign convention is insufficient. We need two coordinates ($x$ and $y$) to describe position.",

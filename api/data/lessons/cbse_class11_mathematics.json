While working on problems related to trigonometric series, Cantor encountered collections of numbers that required a formal definition. He formalized the concept of a 'set' as a distinct mathematical entity. Today, set theory is used to define relations and functions, study sequences, and formulate the rules of probability theory.",

'Well-defined' means that for any given object, we can objectively decide whether it belongs to the collection or not. The objects in a set are called elements or members. We usually denote sets by capital letters (A, B, C) and elements by small letters (x, y, z). If \\( a \\) is an element of set \\( A \\), we write \\( a \\in A \\) (read as 'a belongs to A').

However, in the real world and in advanced mathematics, we are rarely interested in sets in isolation. We care about how elements from one set relate to elements of another. For instance, how does a set of 'Students' link to a set of 'Test Scores'? How does a set of 'Time values' link to 'Position'? This lesson sets the stage for formalizing these connections, moving us from static lists of objects to dynamic relationships.",

                            "explanation": "The fundamental idea behind relations and functions is the concept of pairing or linking elements. Imagine two non-empty sets, Set A and Set B. We can establish a rule or a correspondence that links an element \\( a \\in A \\) to an element \\( b \\in B \\). This is the precursor to the mathematical definition of a relation. In our daily lives, we see this constantly: a country is linked to its capital city, a grocery item is linked to its price, and a person is linked to their ID number. In mathematics, we formalize this by looking at pairs of elements.",

Greek mathematicians like Hipparchus and Ptolemy developed tables of chord lengths—precursors to the sine function—to calculate the positions of planets and stars. In India, the transition from chords to half-chords (jiva) laid the groundwork for the modern sine function. Later, Islamic scholars refined these concepts into the six trigonometric functions we recognize today.

These curves—circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas—have fascinated mathematicians since the time of the ancient Greeks. Apollonius of Perga, known as the 'Great Geometer', gave them their names around 200 B.C. Today, conic sections are not just theoretical constructs; they describe planetary orbits, the path of projectiles, the shape of satellite dishes, and even the navigation systems used by ships and aircraft. In this introductory lesson, we will define what a conic section is and understand the mathematical concept of a 'locus' which underpins their definitions.",

                            "explanation": "A conic section is the curve formed by the intersection of a plane and a right circular cone. Specifically, we consider a double-napped cone, which consists of two cones joined at their vertices. The angle at which the plane slices through the cone determines the shape of the resulting curve. If the plane does not pass through the vertex, the intersection forms one of the four non-degenerate conics: a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola. If the plane passes through the vertex, the intersection results in a degenerate conic, such as a point, a line, or two intersecting lines.",

A **locus** (plural: loci) is a set of all points in a plane that satisfy a specific geometric condition. For example, a circle is the locus of points equidistant from a fixed point. This approach allows us to derive algebraic equations for each shape in the Cartesian coordinate system. Generally, any conic section can be defined as the locus of a point \\( P \\) such that the ratio of its distance from a fixed point (the focus) to its distance from a fixed line (the directrix) is a constant called the eccentricity, \\( e \\).",

If a car travels at a constant speed, its position-time graph is a straight line, and the slope is the speed. However, most real-world motions involve changing speeds, resulting in curved graphs. Calculus allows us to zoom in on these curves. While algebra deals with average rates of change over an interval, calculus allows us to find the *instantaneous* rate of change at a specific moment. This transition requires a new mathematical tool called the 'Limit'.",

If we try to find the slope at a single point where \\( x_2 = x_1 \\), we get division by zero (\\( \\frac{0}{0} \\)). This is where the concept of a limit is essential.

Dividing total distance by total time gives the *average* velocity. However, the speedometer shows your velocity at that exact moment. This reading is the *instantaneous rate of change* of position with respect to time. In calculus, this instantaneous rate is called the derivative. If \\( y = f(x) \\), the derivative measures how fast \\( y \\) is changing right now for a tiny change in \\( x \\).",

To find the rate of change at \\( P \\) alone, we imagine sliding point \\( Q \\) along the curve closer and closer to \\( P \\). As \\( Q \\) approaches \\( P \\), the secant line pivots and approaches a limiting position called the **tangent line**. The derivative of the function at point \\( P \\) is simply the slope of this tangent line. This is why we say the derivative is the 'slope of the curve' at a point.",

Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that quantifies this uncertainty, transforming vague predictions into precise numerical values. In this lesson, we explore the origins of this science and how it relates to statistical observations.",

While some physical phenomena are deterministic (like gravity acting on a dropped ball), many others are governed by chance. Probability provides a measure of how likely an event is to occur. Conceptually, if an event is impossible, its probability is 0; if it is certain, its probability is 1. All other degrees of chance lie between these two extremes. We use this to model complex systems, from weather forecasting to financial markets.",

It began seriously when a French gambler, Chevalier de Méré, posed a problem regarding dice games to the famous mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal communicated with Pierre de Fermat, and their correspondence laid the foundation for the theory. Later, mathematicians like Kolmogorov formalized these concepts into the axiomatic system we use today, moving probability from gambling tables to rigorous science.",

The 'Frequentist' approach defines probability based on the long-run relative frequency of an event. If we repeat an experiment a large number of times, the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of trials tends to stabilize around a specific number. This limiting value is the probability.",

The axiomatic approach, developed by Andrey Kolmogorov, treats probability as a function that assigns real numbers to events according to specific rules (axioms). This lesson formalizes how we calculate likelihood.",

                            "explanation": "Let \\( S \\) be the sample space. We define a probability function \\( P \\) that assigns a real number \\( P(E) \\) to every event \\( E \\). To be valid, this assignment must satisfy three axioms:\n1.  **Non-negativity:** For any event \\( E \\), \\( P(E) \\ge 0 \\).\n2.  **Normalization:** The probability of the sample space is 1, i.e., \\( P(S) = 1 \\).\n3.  **Additivity:** If \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are mutually exclusive events (\\( E \\cap F = \\emptyset \\)), then \\( P(E \\cup F) = P(E) + P(F) \\).",
                            "example": "If a die is weighted such that rolling a 6 is twice as likely as any other number, we can assign probabilities such that \\( P(1)=P(2)=P(3)=P(4)=P(5)=x \\) and \\( P(6)=2x \\). Using Axiom 2: \\( 5x + 2x = 1 \\Rightarrow 7x=1 \\Rightarrow x=1/7 \\). So \\( P(6)=2/7 \\). This satisfies all axioms.",

If the sample space \\( S \\) has \\( n(S) \\) elements and event \\( E \\) has \\( n(E) \\) elements, the probability is given by the ratio: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes in } E}{\\text{Total number of outcomes in } S} = \\frac{n(E)}{n(S)} \\] This is a special case of the axiomatic approach where every sample point \\( \\omega_i \\) is assigned probability \\( 1/n \\).",

The general rule is derived from the axioms: \\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\] Additionally, the probability of an event not happening is \\[ P(\\, \\text{not } A) = P(A') = 1 - P(A) \\].",

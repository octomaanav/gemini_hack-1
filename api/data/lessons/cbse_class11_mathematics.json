                                    "explanation": "The theory of sets was developed by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He encountered sets while working on problems on trigonometric series. Before this, mathematics dealt primarily with concrete numbers and geometric shapes. Cantor's work abstracted these into collections of objects, creating a unified language for mathematics.",

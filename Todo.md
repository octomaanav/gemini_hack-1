### List of todos for the hackathon project

**api/lessons/parse  (sujal)**
Parses information and separate chapters and chapter sections. For example, if I upload a maths textbook, this endpoint should output json with all the chapters and sections from the book and a small summary for each section.


`json format`
[{Chapter: chapter1 trigonometry,
Sections:[1.1:formular,1.2:proofs]},
{chapter: chapter2 fractions…}]
